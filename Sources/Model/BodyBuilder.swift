public protocol BodyBuilder {
	/// Adds the body for the ``Interaction``.
	///
	/// For JSON payloads, matching rules can be embedded in the `body`. See
	/// [IntegrationJson.md](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/blob/master/rust/pact_ffi/IntegrationJson.md).
	///
	/// - Throws: ``Interaction/Error/canNotBeModified`` if the interaction or Pact can't be modified (i.e. the mock server for it has already started).
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - contentType:
	///       The content type of the body. Defaults to `text/plain`. Ignored if a content-type header is already set.
	///       If `nil`, or can't be parsed, it will set the content type as TEXT.
	///   - body: The body contents. If `nil` will set the body contents as null.
	///
